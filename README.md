# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate test automation developer, currently working as an Automation QA with HP Inc. My daily job is to write test scripts to automate the REST APIs and the front-end using the technology stack such as Selenium, Jmeter with java as language binding. It also involves participating in sprint plannings, analyzing system specifications, writing and exceuting test cases, analyzing results and reporting bugs and errors.

I am well adept in developing and updating the automation framework based on the requirements. I have a strong inclination towards open-source tools and continue to strive towards make it tailor-made as per project circumstances. I have a keen eye to detail and have developed the skill of troubleshotting issues.

I have a goal to significantly contribute to the quality of software products and to leave the greatest fingerprint on peopleâ€™s mind by making the world better place.
